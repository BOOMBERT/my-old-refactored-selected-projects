# ðŸ”¹ Description
Solving __systems of equations__ with __two or three unknowns__ in the __terminal__ using the method of __determinants__.

## ðŸ”¹ Example excerpt from the terminal
```
If you want to calculate a system of equations with 2 unknowns enter 2
If you want to calculate a system of equations with 3 unknowns enter 3
Enter here: 3
Enter a1x b1y c1z d1 sequentially after the spaces: 10.001 0 5.9 -2.5
Enter a2x b2y c2z d2 sequentially after the spaces: -4 2.025 -10.075 25
Enter a3x b3y c3z d3 sequentially after the spaces: 0 100 -25.01 40.40

10.001x + 0.0y + 5.9z = -2.5
-4.0x + 2.025y - 10.075z = 25.0
0.0x + 100.0y - 25.01z = 40.4

x = 1.6471568003389871
y = -0.4002713748412833
z = -3.215799179693256
