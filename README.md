# ðŸ”¹ Description
__Refactored__ my old selected __projects__ written in python

## ðŸ”¹ Information
This repository was created for my __selected projects__ that __were written in the past__.
Through this repository I want to show what I have written for my __"drawer"__, because why wouldn't I show it.
In addition, I decided to __refactor__ these projects to show __my progress__ and present the projects in a __better form__.

The refactoring __history of each project__ can be seen in __special branches__ dedicated to each project.\
__Each project__ has its __own README file__, so the __detailed information__ you want to read can be __found there__.
