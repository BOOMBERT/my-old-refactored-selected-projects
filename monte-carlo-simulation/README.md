# ðŸ”¹ Description
__Simulation__ of obtaining the __number pi__ using the __Monte Carlo__ method.
The program includes a __graphical interface__ so that we can notice 
the __changing data__ in __real time__, along with a __board__ 
that makes the simulation look even better and more understandable.

## ðŸ”¹ Excerpt from a sample simulation
![Number pi by method - Monte Carlo - gif](https://github.com/BOOMBERT/my-old-refactored-selected-projects/assets/111244602/8d2b9f43-c647-4de4-8f55-949e12a15204)

It can be noted that the simulation data include:
* Number - *simulated number pi*
* Green points - *points in the circle, green dots on the board*
* Red points - *points outside the circle, red dots on the board*
* All points - *all points, the sum of green and red dots on the board*
